# Online art and design exhibition

The course will culminate in a public online exhibition of course work. This exhibition will be open to the public, and it asks you to present your finished visual works, project documentation, and a work statement. This exhibition will remain archived on the DMD website. You can choose to use a pseudonym when presenting your work publicly, either to obscure your name for privacy reasons, or to associate your exhibition work with an existing online presence/branding you have previously built.

Do not submit work to the online exhibition space that is not your own that could construed as a copyright violation. This includes copyrighted music, images, video, and other works that are protected under copyright laws. If you worked with other people who have a claim over the copyright of the works, please have documentation on hand that clearly shows that you were given permission to showcase the work, either through a creative commons license, or through other types of permissions.

The online exhibition format is not a new, but is a wonderful opportunity to publicly showcase your work and writing skills. See these examples of other online art and design exhibitions:
