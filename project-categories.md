# Project categories

A typical capstone project will fall within one of the following categories. Each category lists its own set of recommended production requirements and expectations for a proof of concept. It is possible to develop a project idea that does not fall within a particular category. Please contact your instructor if you feel your project is not adequately addressed in the options below:

* [Animation](/animation.md)
* [Realtime and interactive](/interactive.md)
* [Product, service, UI/UX](/product-or-service.md)
* [2D / 3D design and illustration](/2D-or-3D-design-illustration.md)
* [Video production](/audiovideo.md)
* [Art or design intervention](/installation-art-or-design-intervention.md)
