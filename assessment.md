# Assessment

Students in DMD400 are assessed on their ability to synthesize a feasible design project, produce deliverables on time, and engage with a design process they outlined for the project.

To pass the course, students must meet the capstone requirements indicated in the capstone project section.

Students will be asked to **repeat** the course if:

- Student fails to produce an adequate project proposal by the deadline.
- Student does not check-in with mentors by deadlines
- Student does not deliver all properly formatted project deliverables
- Student faces unfortunate and unavoidable life crisis. While this is regrettable, the student must participate in the online exhibition to pass the course requirements. Students will not be allowed to participate if they do not complete the project deliverables and meet the deadlines.
