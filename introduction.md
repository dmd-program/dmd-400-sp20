# Introduction

This course follows [DMD 300: Digital Multimedia Design Studio](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/dmd-program/dmd-100-sp19/details). In that course, students participated in a group design project, and developed their own independent project using digital formats and tools of their choosing. In DMD 400: Digital Multimedia Design Capstone, students will have the opportunity to develop a focused capstone project.

## Course description

In this capstone, students develop portfolio projects by applying creative production concepts, tools, and approaches to a contemporary issue. DMD 400 Digital Multimedia Design Capstone is an advanced, senior-level capstone experience, students will synthesize the concepts, tools, and approaches learned throughout their studies and demonstrate competencies in creative and technical production in an applied human-centered thesis project. Students will work as change agents to address a critical, real-world, local or global issue or challenge and work through the design process to complete a capstone project. Students will explore processes in interdisciplinary problem spaces and connect to broader context of design decisions promoting agency over project outcomes, applications, deliverables, and knowledge-sharing.

Student projects will include design proposals and/or implementations for digital or physical products and systems. To examine their understanding of design leadership, students will practice design thinking and production methods to generate project ideas, discover opportunities, and communicate intent; practice systems thinking to define the boundaries and impact of a problem space; and practice critical thinking to evaluate research issues, develop meaning, and inspire creative output. Students will be able to deploy project management skills to ensure on-time delivery of final project, communicate project concepts through visual models, and will leverage a variety of digital resources and methods to disseminate work in online contexts including social media, websites, and others.
