# Concept development

A concept is a core idea \(or set of ideas\) that signify basic values, motivations and practices inherent in a project. A project lacking strong concept development tends to be shallow and without regard for cultural and community contexts, which will become apparent during discussion and critique. There are two typical concept development approaches. The _directed concept approach_ refers to when a concept is established and defined at the beginning stages of project development, and the _emerging concept approach_ is were the concept is allowed to emerge and evolve during the production of a project.

**Situating \(Directed concept approach\):**

* "Top-down" approach
* Process of deduction

Concepts are directed through a mapping process either before or in the beginning stages of a project. An interpretation of outcomes of an inquiry will depend in part on the frame of reference of existing knowledge. What is known helps identify what is not. Situating is a method that opens up lines of inquiry commonly used to review literature and information sources in the public domain. Situating is a curatorial process for looking at existing things in new ways.

**Revealing \(Emerging concept approach\):**

* "Bottom-up" approach
* Process of induction

Concepts emerge over the course of the project through an ongoing discovery process. A core purpose of inquiry is to discover new knowledge or the possibility of thinking about things in new, innovative ways. To reveal something relies on others experiencing a change of awareness or understanding. Revealing, therefore is not only a method of discovery, but requires multiple ways of communicating to target groups and others.

A project concept is always in support of an overarching theme or purpose. A well developed concept can help the artist or designer to ask questions in novel or provocative ways or to find new approaches to solving problems or eliciting emotional responses. Once you have the concept, all decisions are for the purpose of expressing it as effectively as possible. Depending on your interests, you don't always have to develop the core theme or issue.

## How to develop a good concept

Creative thinking methods are helpful for identifying a concept. However, more often than not, everyday observations are enough to spark an idea. It is helpful to keep around a small notebook or store a running list of ideas on a mobile device.

**Key features of a good concept:**

1. Feasible to accomplish in the given timeframe
2. Invention and/or unexpected combinations to produce novelty 
3. Links to relevant cultural, historical, social contexts
4. Explores moral and ethical issues or quandaries
5. Aesthetic and theoretical explorations

In DMD 100, students are guided through the entire production of three projects through a careful orchestration of design thinking exercises and a set of rules or criteria that bounded the scope. The rules set in place made it so that the student could concentrate on the content of the project, rather than finding an appropriate scale and bounds for the project. In a capstone project, students are responsible for establishing these rules for themselves, an often difficult task that takes practice to master.
