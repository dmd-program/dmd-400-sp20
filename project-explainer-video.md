# Project explainer video

Produce a short video presentation that documents and explains the project process and outcomes for a general audience unfamiliar with the work.

## Creating the video

There are different approaches to documentation video. A typical documentation video consists of the following:

1. Short concept statement on screen. Ensure that it is visible long enough to be read. This should simply be readable white text on a black background.
2. Images or video clips showing the work at various stages of development, or key aspects that you developed to make the project successful.
3. Overlay text on top of the images and video to describe the project's development and outcomes. Alternatively, you can use voice narration to describe the project.
