## Capstone project exhibition

The course will culminate in a public online exhibition of course work. This exhibition will be open to the public, and it asks you to present your finished visual works, project documentation, and a work statement. This exhibition will remain archived on the DMD website. You can choose to use a pseudonym when presenting your work publicly, either to obscure your name for privacy reasons, or to associate your exhibition work with an existing online presence/branding you have previously built.

Do not submit work to the online exhibition space that is not your own that could construed as a copyright violation. This includes copyrighted music, images, video, and other works that are protected under copyright laws. If you worked with other people who have a claim over the copyright of the works, please have documentation on hand that clearly shows that you were given permission to showcase the work, either through a creative commons license, or through other types of permissions.

The online exhibition format is not a new, but is a wonderful opportunity to publicly showcase your work and writing skills. See these examples of other online art and design exhibitions:

## Media

When you have finished your project, you will need to submit media files for display on the exhibition website. Media files will vary from project to project, however, it is typical to have gallery images to highlight your project.

The exhibition website uses a site generator, and is sensitive to file names. Please use the exact filename structures listed for each item below.

### Instructions:

**Download:** [Media template files (5.9MB)](//assets/media-templates.zip)

Unless you are using a pseudonym, replace **[last-name]** in the file with your last name and **[first-name]** with your first name.

If you ARE using a pseudonym, please use it in place of **\[last-name\]\[first-name\]**.

#### Exhibition card image (required)

The exhibition card image will be displayed on the exhibition projects index page card, along with other student's work. The project name and student name will be displayed under the card image.

* Keep text to a minimum.
* Do not include the name of the project unless it is part of a logo or branding.

**File name:** `[last-name][first-name]-exhibition-card-image-1200x600.jpg`

#### Gallery images

Gallery images are shown on your project's profile page. Try to include between 3 to 12 images. Images can be close up views of details, documentation of process, etc. Do not include images larger than 1200px in any dimension. Use Photoshop to export `.jpg` images for display on the web at a compressed file size.

**File name:**

1. `[last-name][first-name]-gallery-image-01.jpg`
2. `[last-name][first-name]-gallery-image-02.jpg`
3. `[last-name][first-name]-gallery-image-03.jpg`
4. `[last-name][first-name]-gallery-image-##.jpg`


#### Video files

Video files require a poster image that is displayed before the video files loads. Youtube and Vimeo typically create these automatically, however, you will need to include one with your video file. If you have more than one video file, please match the numbering of the poster to the video file.

**Example poster image name:** `[last-name][first-name]-video-poster-01.jpg`

**Example video file name:** `[last-name][first-name]-video-01.mp4`

#### Interactive elements

If you are using an embedded interactive element, please include the embed code in a `.txt` file. If your interactive elements require many files to operate, please include a `.zip` file of those files.

**File name:**

`[last-name][first-name]-embed-01.txt` **or** `[last-name][first-name]-files-01.zip`

#### Audio

Convert audio files to `.mp3` so they may be playable from a web browser.

**Example audio files:** `[last-name][first-name]-audio.mp3`
