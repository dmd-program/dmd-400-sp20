# Product, service, UI/UX

There are a few ways to approach a project design project. To participate in a real-world project, you will need to locate a client — a company, event, organization, group, etc. — that has a specific challenge. You can then work with the client to design a solution that meets a need or opportunity. Whether you are working with web and information technology, or 3D printing physical prototypes, many aspects of the design process will be similar.

## Types of product or service projects

* Functional mobile or web app
* High fidelity interactive mockups \(UI\)
* Speculative or discursive design projects
* Comprehensive user experience \(UX\) research 
* Digital fabrication products or prototypes \(handheld objects, furniture, wearables, clothes, toys, etc.\)
* Physical computing and IoT device 

**Note about design projects requiring fabrication equipment:** If you are interested in using PSU Main Campus fabrication equipment including laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC Routers, water-jet cutters, etc., you must coordinate a time to visit, complete requisite safety training in advance, and schedule a time on the required machines. Contact your professor for more information. Depending on your location, it is often less expensive to pay for an object to be fabricated using an online service or local company rather than paying for travel and lodging to come to Penn State Main Campus.

### Proof of concept

The goal of a proof is to demonstrate that you have a strong grasp of relevant research, design, fabrication, and/or development principles.

Produce a basic example of a project in your web technology or digital fabrication technology of choice that demonstrates you are capable of producing digital assets and code.
