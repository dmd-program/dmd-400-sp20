   * Background or qualifications for advisor, mentor or client
5. **Production scope**
   * What are the deliverables to be completed or produced? \(IE - storyboards, interviews, web application, website, wireframes, animatics, character designs, scripts, game executable, video, etc.\)
   * What is the culmination of the production? (EG - Animated video, interactive app prototype, video documentation of an installation, etc.) 
6. **Production pipeline**

     * What required capabilities and skills do you not currently possess that are needed to complete the project.
     * Explain how you will you get up to speed in time.
8. **Timeline**
   * List all steps anticipated in the production of the project and assign them to a due date. The timeline can be graphic in nature so long as it is readable.
   * Ensure the timeline is feasible.
9. **Research**
   * What areas of research do you intend to pursue during the production of this project?
     * Your project should include either a contemporary critical issue, explore critical theory, or relate the project to design methods and principles.    
   * What research resources available to you?
10. **Questions for your proposal reviewers**
   * List three questions that might help you better some aspect of the project. Avoid vague questions such as, “_Is this a good project_?” or “_What should I do?_”. Instead focus your questions on the specific areas of your project that could benefit from feedback.
